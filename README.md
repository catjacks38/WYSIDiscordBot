### Read before usage.
I can't fucking take it. 
I see an image of a random score posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. 
"Oh that looks kinda like the Blue Zenith 727 score" it started as. 
That's funny, that's a cool reference. 
But I kept going. 
I'd see a clock with time that showed 7:27. 
I'd see that I'm on the 7/27 page on my school homework. 
My last notice to pay my electricity bill is 727$. 
I'd notice that it's been 727 days since the last time I touched a woman. 
And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the number 727 ran through my head. 
I'm scared to look at the time when someone asks me what time is it. 
It's torment, psychological torture. 
I am being conditioned to laugh manically anytime I see an 3-digit number which is anywhere close to 727. 
I can't fucking live like this... 
I can't! 
I can't! 
I can't! 
I can't! 
I can't! 
And don't get me fucking started on the words!
I'll never hear the phrase "when you see it" again without thinking of 727. 
Someone does pretty cool and respectable score, I can't say anything other than "WYSI".
I could watch a man FC hard under-weighted map I love, and all I would be able to say is "WYSI", and laugh like a fucking insane person. 
And the phrase "when you see it" is ruined. 
I can't live anymore. 727 has destroyed my fucking life. 
I want to eject myself from this plane of existence.
